This Project is an attempt at learning [React](https://reactjs.org/) by creating a mini-youtube player of sorts. The 
web app plays video embed using the youtube API. 

## Packages Used

The following packages were used while building this app:

### `axios`

[Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. The package 
is used in the app to make request to the youtube API instead of the vanilla javascript's `get` method.
